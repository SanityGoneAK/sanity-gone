# Introduction

Heya all! Mal here with another Arknights Module write up. This time around it’s for the Fantasy in the Mirage patch, which introduces Leizi the Thunderbringer. This patch is a little unusual for me, as it doesn’t actually introduce Modules for a whole archetype, only Modules for new Operators and second Modules for existing Operators. I suppose it makes the writeups a bit less repetitive at least. While it won’t strictly speaking be available at the time this event drops, I’m also including the IS6 welfare Operator Raidian’s Module in this writeup. IS6 should release about a week after this event, so I figured it made more sense to include that one Operator in this writeup than do another tiny one just a week later.

Both new Operators added this patch come with Modules, Leizi the Thunderbringer and the 5★ of her banner, Record Keeper. 

Leizi Alter is a very cool Operator. She’s a liberator guard like Młynar, however her gameplay differs significantly. Her playstyle is much more involved and has some interesting advanced applications, at the expense of some ease of use. Her Module is a pretty easy W, leaning into her flexible skill timings, and improving her damage. The Liberator Trait upgrade really synergizes with Leizi (especially her S1)  much more than any previous Liberator, which is fun to see, and the Talent upgrade is a straightforward unconditional numbers buff.

Record Keeper on the other hand is a bit more of a gimmick Operator. He synergizes with his buddy Chongyue, or other Powerstrike style skill Operators, with his SP battery and ASPD buff. He also has a fun heal that temporarily turns Operators into Ulpianus with the “per hit heal” effect. Unfortunately, his Module only really benefits his (unimpressive before and after) healing, and his ASPD buff, not the more impactful SP batterying effect. 

Next is Raidian, again, coming with IS6, not this patch strictly speaking, she received a specialized Module (though, unusually for specialized Modules, this one’s effects are only active in specifically IS6). I think this is a good idea by HG to give IS welfare Ops specialised Modules since that is when they’re most likely to be used anyway. However for Raidian they leaned into the welfare Operator concept much further than they ever have before. Not only are she and all of her potentials obtained via her incarnation of IS, but all of her upgrades are unlocked via completing little missions in IS6. This means that she is 100% free to build, which makes her very easy to recommend. Furthermore, it doesn’t hurt that she’s really good too! Her Module is similarly good, anyone with any interest in IS6 should build it.

We got three 2nd Modules for Operators this time around. Goldenglow, Gavial the Invincible, and Typhon all received one. 

Goldenglow received the Mech-Accord Caster Y Module. This is a case study for my advice on not waiting for hypothetical second Modules. When GG’s first Module released and people saw that it wasn’t buffing the RES-ignore Talent, many people said “oh well surely her second Module will be way better, I’ll just wait for that one!” First of all, not only did her second Module release a whole year and a half later (an eternity in gacha game time), but it’s just generally worse in most cases than her first Module. More RES-ignore is indeed nice, but it simply isn’t enough to outcompete her other Module’s increased drone self-destruct damage and ability to cope with the rapid target switching that is typical of GG S3 use. This Module isn’t strictly worse in every case, but it requires very tanky single enemies for GG to lock onto to benefit from, and furthermore, the popular Yu + drone Caster combo dilutes the importance of the RES-ignore from this Module! I have a hard time recommending people build second Modules unless they’re head and shoulders better than the first one, and this simply isn’t it.

Gavial2 received the Centurion Y Module. This one is truly bizarre. HG seemed to look at Gavial2 and decided “she’s not tanky enough” and gave us a Module that focuses on her survivability. She was never the best laneholder in the first place, and in an era of Arknights where laneholders are already fairly underwhelming, this Module doesn't do anything close to enough to help her be more competitive. In most cases her first Module’s damage improvements are far more relevant for those who do want to use Gavial2 in almost the year 2026.

Lastly, Typhon also received a second Module, the Besieger Y Module. This case, despite my “Not Recommended” rating, is a little bit more complex, as this new Module is head-and-shoulders better for Typhon’s S2 use. The problem is that despite its ease of use, Typhon’s S2 use is simply not that meta relevant, it’s something people do for comfort reasons, so I can’t really feel comfortable recommending it given my general focus on ceiling performance over ease of use. Meanwhile, for Typhon’s S3, the part of her kit that is still somewhat relevant, this Module is flat out inferior to her first. Players who do value her AFK gameplay and S2 might find this Module more valuable than I do, but for players who use her S3 they should usually stick to her X Module.

# Ratings System

This rating system aims to capture both the relative “meta value” of a unit as well as the strength of a Module. My aim is to have the ratings give an at a glance understanding for those just trying to figure out what is “good”, while those already interested in a unit regardless of the meta value of said unit, can read the detailed write-up of each Module to find out if it’s right for them, even if it’s a Module on a relatively low value Operator.

Each Module will be given a rating of [YES], [MAYBE], or [NOT RECOMMENDED] for whether it is worth building, as well as a recommended level to upgrade it to.

For Specialized Modules, ratings are given with the assumption that players are interested in the applicable game mode (for example Integrated Strategies).

# Ratings

## New Operators

### Leizi the Thunderbringer

---|---
Mod-X| Yes
Recommended Level | Level 3

<ModuleRecommendation moduleId="LIB-X" charId="char_1043_leizi2" client:load/>

Leizi the Thunderbringer brings with her the damage ceiling Liberator Guards are famous for, but unlike many of her predecessors, has intricate gameplay with a variety of nuances and advanced applications. This Module both leans into her advanced applications, and simply increases her damage.

The Trait upgrade of this Module grants Leizi half of the Liberator Trait’s scaling +ATK% upon deployment. Unlike her fellow Liberators, Leizi has multiple good skills, one of which is a charge-based skill with low SP cost, her S1. The upfront portion of the +ATK% this Trait upgrade gives allows her to wind up with her S1 very effectively, as it can be immediately activated (albeit still without the full Trait scaling yet). Her other two skills also benefit from the Trait, in a way more similar to the typical Liberator skills, as they both have relatively short wind up time, thus she can reach maximum Trait scaling in time to activate them, rather than being forced to choose between activating these skills at lower scaling or waiting longer to activate. 

The Talent upgrade of this Module improves her first Talent. The lighting strike portion is unaffected, the only change is to her ATK scaling modifier while her skills are active, increasing from 107% up to 113%. This might seem like a modest upgrade, and while it’s certainly not the largest damage improvement of any Module, alongside the base ATK the Module gives, this upgrade results in significant damage improvements for Leizi (approximately 17% more DPS).

One of Leizi’s major advantages is her flexibility. She has multiple viable skills with different strengths and this Module further increases her flexibility *and* gives her a decent amount more damage on top. Module level 1 or 2 do provide all the utility with less of the damage improvement, but Leizi is good enough that it’s worth building her all the way to level 3 for the full damage gain.

### Raidian

[Raidian](https://arknights.wiki.gg/wiki/Raidian)| ![Raidian](https://arknights.wiki.gg/images/Raidian_icon.png?d99503)
---|---
Mod-α| Yes (Special Case)
Recommended Level | Level 3

Raidian is a special case Operator in that she costs zero resources to build, and her Module is a specialized Module. Unlike previous specialized Modules however, this one only works in IS6. She’s completely free to build, she merely requires the player complete certain missions in IS6. As a result, this Module is fairly easy to assess. Radian is an extremely powerful Operator and unless players have zero interest in IS6 they should plan to build her and her Module.

The Trait upgrade (which only functions in IS6) of this Module gives Raidian 5 extra Summon capacity at once, and each summon has a 25% chance to be recovered when retreated or defeated. This upgrade allows players to be much more aggressive about placing and retreating Raidian’s Summons.

The Talent upgrade (only in IS6) grants her summons -50% redeployment time, and Raidian restores 2 SP whenever her Summons are retreated or defeated. Once again, this leans into an aggressive playstyle of placing and retreating Raidian’s Summons.

Overall this Module is a very easy win for any player using Raidian. It enables her to maintain a large stock of Summons and to use them aggressively across the map.


### Record Keeper

[Record Keeper](https://arknights.wiki.gg/wiki/Record_Keeper)| ![Record Keeper](https://arknights.wiki.gg/images/Record_Keeper_icon.png?8b8438)
---|---
Mod-X| Not Recommended

Record Keeper is a part of a long line of low rarity Medics who mostly just heal but also have a slight gimmick that isn’t quite strong enough to merit bringing them from a meta perspective, but is fun enough to be rewarding for those who like them. In Record Keeper’s case, he has two things that make him stand out from other Medics. First, his skill which provides a “heal on taking hits” to allies he heals, and second, his Talent which rewards Powerstrike style skill allies by providing SP and ASPD each time they activate their skill. Unfortunately, his Module improves neither of these by any noticeable degree, and is thus hard to recommend for all but the most dedicated maximalists of this character.

The Trait upgrade of this Module grants Record Keeper 15% stronger heals when targeting allied units with less than 50% HP. If players are using Record Keeper as their primary source of healing, this could be a handy upgrade to have, but it doesn’t do enough to make his healing keep up with the best Medics.

The Talent upgrade improves the ASPD buff Record Keeper grants to allies, increasing it from +16 to +23. This being the second part of his Talent that grants SP to allies after activating their skills. This can be a decent enough buff for allies using Powerstrike style skills, but those skills are generally not particularly meta relevant, and even then, Record Keeper is fairly far down the list of effective support units for them. 

Record Keeper’s kit is certainly lore accurate in how he synergizes with Chongyue, but unfortunately the 5★ power budget doesn’t allow for him to be particularly competitive with other buff Operators out there, even just the ones that can also heal! His Module doesn’t do nearly enough to change this scenario. 


## Second Modules

### Goldenglow

---|---
Mod-Y| Not Recommended

Goldenglow’s second Module is generally inferior to her first in most cases. There are a few scenarios of high RES tanky targets where it can surpass the first, but not by much, and it’s noticeably worse the rest of the time.

The Trait upgrade of this Module increases the maximum ramped up damage Goldenglow’s drones can deal, up to 120% of her ATK. Mech-Accord Caster’s drones start out dealing 20% of their ATK, ramping up by 15% per hit. This means that at the pre-Module drone damage cap of 110% can be reached after 6 hits, while the Module Y cap of 120% can be reached after 7 hits. For some Mech-Accord Casters this increased cap is more relevant than for Goldenglow however, as one of her Talents result in her drones self-destructing before reacquiring targets. While the drones don’t lose their bonus if they reacquire the same target, due to the built-in slow effect on her S3, they will often realistically acquire a *different* target and lose that accumulated bonus. The increased starting Drone ATK scaling of her other Module tends to be much more impactful in these situations.

The Talent upgrade of this Module improves Goldenglow’s RES ignore Talent. Goldenglow and her drones will ignore 20 RES, up from 15. This half of the Module is simple but impactful. RES ignore is a powerful piece of any Caster’s kit, and for Goldenglow it allows her to do significantly better sustained damage against high-RES targets. Importantly though, this comes with the opportunity cost of the higher drone self-destruct damage from her other Module. 

This Module can result in higher DPS in optimal scenarios than Goldenglow’s first Module, however in more realistic scenarios it will often not reach those peaks. This Module is the latest in a long line of second Modules that are potential side-grades to first Modules, and are as a result simply not worthwhile for all but the most dedicated maximalists of those Operators. This Module is simply an upgrade in too few realistic scenarios.



### Gavial the Invincible

---|---
Mod-Y| Not Recommended

Gavial the Invincible has not fared particularly well over the years. Laneholder-style Operators have diminished significantly in importance over time, and Gavial was not the most impressive laneholder even at the time of her release. Even worse, this Module leans into her survivability rather than her damage, creating a quite underwhelming result.

The Trait upgrade of this Module reduces the physical damage Gavial takes by 20% when she is above 50% HP. While it’s certainly true that Gavial’s kit has a fair amount of survivability oriented features, those features by themselves make her quite tanky in most reasonable situations, and as a result this Trait upgrade is only particularly impactful in some very borderline scenarios.

This Module’s Talent upgrade improves Gavial’s second Talent. It adds a feature, Gavial will now inflict 10% Physical Fragile on blocked enemies, and it also increases her healing received by 30%, 60% when she is below half HP. Once again, most of this Talent improves Gavial’s survivability, which is overall not urgently needed. Gavial is already above average when it comes to laneholder survivability, however this improvement doesn’t do nearly enough to help her compete with actual defensive options. The 10% Fragile might initially seem like a nice Damage bump but when compared to the damage gains of her first Module it’s a woeful downgrade.

This Module is a simply baffling set of upgrades that seem to encourage using Gavial as a more defensive laneholder, however it doesn’t do enough to really justify picking her over one of the actually exceptional defensive options in Arknights. Meanwhile choosing this Module means giving up a substantial amount of offensive capabilities that her first Module provides. This Module is an easy skip.



### Typhon

[Typhon](https://arknights.wiki.gg/wiki/Typhon)| ![Typhon](https://arknights.wiki.gg/images/Typhon_icon.png?3bf745)
---|---
Mod-Y| Not Recommended

Typhon had the misfortune of arriving right before Arknights seemingly embarked on a major powercreep trend. She’s still a fairly powerful Operator, but a decent chunk of that comes from the strength of her first Module. This second Module, in contrast, leans into her much lower ceiling AFK gameplay.

The Trait upgrade of this Module increases Typhon’s damage dealt by up to 12% depending on how far away the enemy is. First of all, the peak of this damage improvement is only possible at the very edge of her natural range. Her S3 does allow for players to exploit this Trait more effectively, but the rest of this Module synergizes much better with Typhon’s S2 instead of her S3. Second of all, this is damage amplification, meaning that 12% increase is applied *after* DEF calculations. While Typhon does have impressive, high-quality damage, thanks to her DEF-ignore Talent, her other Module’s Trait is a pre-DEF ATK buff. While it’s true that her first Module’s buff is conditional, most dangerous enemies worth focusing on can trigger the high-weight condition of the Besieger X Module anyway.

The Talent upgrade of this Module improves Typhon’s second Talent. It changes the condition to trigger on the first *two* hits on an enemy during a skill, and increases the ATK multiplier up to 220%. This damage increase is quite significant, as well as the two-hit condition improvement. This can result in Typhon’s S2 being much more consistent in killing enemies with the first double hit. Unfortunately, it does less for Typhon’s S3, which tends to rely much more on her DEF-ignore than on the “first hit” Talent. Furthermore, giving up the improved DEF-ignore from Typhon’s first Module tends to be a much bigger downside when using her S3.

For players who focus on Typhon primarily for her S2 AFK gaming, this Module will actually be a reasonable, but not massive upgrade. However most of the appeal of her S2 these days is comfort, not ceiling performance. When it comes to ceiling performance, Typhon’s S3 is the primary object of relevance, and this Module is simply inferior in almost every situation for Typhon’s S3 use. As a result this Module is not recommended.
